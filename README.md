This one was the project for my semester 2 module computer organization and degital design. It was done using Vivado Softeware using VHDL definition language.
It was a two person group project.
The task were
1) create logical design using VHDL language for a nano processor(not about size but functionalityðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ)
2) simulate the design on the software
3) upload and run it on programmable board (we used Basys3)
